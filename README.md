# StarWars API

This is my final project in my Advanced Javascript course. I have used JSON, AXAJ and Typescript to be able to fetch from an API and display its data. This project uses the https://swapi.dev/ API.

## Technologies
- Typescript
- AJAX
- SASS
- HTML
- Parcel Build Tool

## What can I do? 
With this program, the user is able to see all the movie titles from Star Wars and also click on each movie title in order to see the description. 

There is also an input field where the user can submit a character name which will display info about that specific character. 

At last, I have showcased planet names by fetching from the API and added random facts about each and one of them.


## How to clone, install and run
1) Clone my repo to local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/Alesa3/StarWars-API.git
```

2) Enter repo directory

```
cd StarWars-API
```

3) Install dev dependencies

```
npm install
```

4) Start the dev server that will watch for saved changes to your SCSS-files and TS-files

```
npm run start
```


Done! Have fun :)
